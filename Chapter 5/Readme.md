This chapter focused on fostering cyber awareness among smart system users.
<br>An aware user could enforce achievable countermeasures and therefore, secure their network and connected smart devices.
<br>Additionally, it is known that major botnet attacks have been realised using non-secured or weakly-secured home devices.
<br>Therefore, there is a critical need to educate a potential buyer or a user about compromise history of vendors.
<br>Another contribution of this chapter was to understand how trust in specific vendors drove buying decisions of people.
