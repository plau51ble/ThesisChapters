### Chapter 3 of my Ph.D. thesis is focused on the enhancement of data privacy through randomization and partial replacement by synthetic data.

The proposed approach named <i>Sarve</i> is an adaptive frequency oracle which used Generalized Random Response, Optimized Unary Encoding, and RAPPOR for randomization. The remaining attribute values were replaced using synthetic data belonging to the attribute domain.
